#Instagram Hashtag Liker
This project demonstrates how to use the instagrapi library to log in to an Instagram account and like posts based on a specific hashtag.

#Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python and the instagrapi library installed. You can install the library using the following command:


pip install instagrapi

#Usage
Create a text file named credentials.txt in the same directory as the project files. In the credentials.txt file, provide your Instagram account credentials in the following format:

username
password
Replace username with your Instagram username and password with your Instagram password. Make sure there are no leading or trailing spaces in the file.

Run the Python script main.py to execute the project.

python main.py
The script will log in to your Instagram account using the provided credentials.

It will then like the top posts related to the specified hashtag. In this case, the hashtag is set to "bookstagram".

The script will iterate over the collection of posts and like each post individually. It will also print a message indicating the number of the liked post and the hashtag.

Note: It's important to use this script responsibly and within the limits and guidelines set by Instagram. Automated actions on Instagram should comply with their terms of service and API usage policies.
